# FitLit - Fitness & Wellness Tracker

## Abstract
In this project, we were tasked with building out a fitness tracking application, while focusing on Object Oriented Programming.

With each page refresh a new random user's fitness information is displayed. There are widgets displaying various aspects of the user's health for the current day (default to Sunday 2019/09/22) or previous week.

To encourage user interaction, data is shown for the entire FitLit user-base fitness benchmarks and a friend step challenge, as well. The friend challenge analyzes the current user's and their friends steps taken in the week, and declares the winner.

## In Action
Below is the landing page for FitLit. We can see there is a Contact widget showing the user's personal information and friends list. A Hydration, Sleep Time, and Sleep Quality widget. All these display the current user's hydrating and sleep history information. Similar information about all user's averages are displayed as well, as a point of reference for the user.

Further down, we can see the Miles Walked, Minutes Active, Stairs Climbed, and Steps Taken widgets.

In the last portion of the application, the Friend Step Challenge and the log of dates the user achieved their step goal are now visible.

Here, it's shown when the current user wins the Step Challenge. FitLit gives a friendly congratulatory message.

## Learning Goals
- Follow the specification below to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Display information on the page while maintaining ability to test class properties and methods
- Create a data dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way

### Wins
- Gaining greater understanding of OOP and practice implementing complex object interaction
- Furthering practice with TDD, writing a robust testing suite
- Writing nested iterator prototypes to fulfill operations between objects

### Challenges
- We tried to import the 3rd party library charts.js to render our data in a more appealing way. But ultimately, couldn't link up the correct number pathways into the library. (pictured below)
